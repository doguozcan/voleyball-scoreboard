# Volleyball Scoreboard

## About

Volleyball Scoreboard is an app that I've built in order to practice my Redux and Redux Toolkit skills. With this app, you can track your volleyball match's score.

## Features

- **Score Increment & Decrement**: You can keep track of the volleyball game by incrementing and decrementing the score.
- **Considered Edge Cases**: If there is a tie like 24-24 or 14-14 in the last set, the app handles that.
- **RTK and React Redux Features**: RTK's hooks such as configureStore, createSlice or react-redux's methods such as useSelector and useDispatch used in the app so you can practice your Redux skills with this app.
